# pokedex
 This is a Pokédex, it is used to look up all the information about your favorite Pokémon. Catch them all!


Typography:
I usually calculate more styles for all the h tags, but for this project, as I'm not going to need it and it is not planned to escalate I only going to use two styles which are titles and text.
